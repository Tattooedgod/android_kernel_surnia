Upstream Info:
Source code is from Motorola's published Styx LTE 5.0.2 kernel source at
https://github.com/MotorolaMobilityLLC/kernel-msm/tree/lollipop-5.0.2-release-styxlte

Build tools required:
- arm-none-eabi-gcc
- gcc (for your host)

You also need an initramfs image compatible with your ROM. You can obtain this
by extracting your original boot.img with the unpack-bootimg utility located at
tools/mkbootimg/unpack-bootimg

Name and place your ramdisk at boot/ramdisk/initramfs.cpio.gz

How to build:
export ARCH=arm

export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi-
make mrproper
make msm8916_defconfig
make bootimage -j10
make modules -j10
./build_cwm_zip.sh
