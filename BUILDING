How to build:
export ARCH=arm
export SUBARCH=arm
export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi-
make msm8916_defconfig
make -j10

You now have a kernel zImage. You now need to build a boot.img
To do this, you need an initial ramdisk and device tree image.
You can get these by extracting an existing boot.img with the unpack-bootimg
utility located at mkbootimg/unpack-bootimg

Name and place your ramdisk at boot/ramdisk/initramfs.cpio.gz
Name and place your device tree image at boot/dt.img

You can get more tools for working with boot images at
http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2319018
Note that the linked tools on XDA can't handle device tree images

To build the boot image, run:
make bootimage -j10

Now you can flash your boot image:
fastboot flash boot arch/arm/boot/boot.img
