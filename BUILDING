How to build:
export ARCH=arm
export SUBARCH=arm
export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi-
make msm8916_defconfig
make -j10

You now have a kernel zImage. You now need to build a boot.img

You need an initial ramdisk for this. You can get one by extracting a stock
boot.img using the unpack script from here:
http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2319018

Name and place your ramdisk at boot/ramdisk/initrd.gz

You also need a device tree. Currently, the easiest way to extract it
is to look for the device tree in the stock boot.img and manually separate
it with dd. It is located at a page boundary after the kernel zImage end,
starts with the letters 'QCDT' and is around 4 megabytes in size (+- a bit).
The end of the tree will be zero padded to make it a nice size.
Yes, I know this method is awful.

Name and place your device tree image at boot/dt.img

To build the boot image, run:
make bootimage -j10

Now you can flash your boot image:
fastboot flash boot arch/arm/boot/boot.img
